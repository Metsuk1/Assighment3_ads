MyHashTable and Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementations in Java              
How to Run:               
    Clone this repository.          
    Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.          
    Run the provided test classes (MyHashTableTest and MyBSTest) to see the data structures in action.        
    
MyHashTable          
Operations:        
put(K key, V value): Insert/update elements            
get(K key): Retrieve values by key            
remove(K key): Delete elements          
contains(V value): Check value existence          
getKey(V value): Find key by value          

MyBST          
Operations:          
put(K key, V value): Insert elements          
get(K key): Search by key          
delete(K key): Remove nodes         

Perfomance:         
HashTable insert-delete methods,Time Complexity:O(1)          
MyBST insert-delete methods,Time Complexity:O(log n)
